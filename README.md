## Project Overview: Data Compression Tool in C
## Project Title: Data Compression Tool in C

Project Description:
This project focuses on developing a data compression tool using the C programming language. Data compression is the process of reducing the size of data files to save storage space or transmission time. The goal of this project is to implement a simple yet effective compression algorithm, enabling users to compress and decompress data files. The tool will demonstrate both lossless and lossy compression techniques (depending on the design chosen) and provide basic file manipulation features like reading, writing, and compressing/decompressing files. The implementation of this tool will offer insights into how compression algorithms work at the binary level and provide hands-on experience in optimizing data storage and transmission.

Key Features:

Compression Algorithms:
The project includes the implementation of a standard compression algorithm such as Huffman Coding, Run-Length Encoding (RLE), or Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW). Each algorithm focuses on reducing the file size by identifying patterns or repetitive data, making it suitable for text or binary file types.

Lossless Compression:
The compression tool implements a lossless compression approach, where no data is lost during compression or decompression, ensuring that the original file can be perfectly restored. Common examples of lossless compression include Huffman Coding and LZW.

File Handling:
The tool reads input data from files, compresses or decompresses the data, and outputs the result to new files. Users can specify the input and output files via command-line arguments or a simple user interface. The program efficiently handles binary and text file formats.

Compression Ratio:
The program computes and displays the compression ratio, showing the percentage reduction in file size before and after compression. This feature provides feedback on the effectiveness of the compression algorithm.

Decompression:
The tool supports both compression and decompression processes. Users can decompress previously compressed files to restore the original content using the corresponding decompression algorithm.

Error Handling:
Error detection and handling are incorporated throughout the program to manage issues such as invalid file formats, corruption, or incorrect input. The tool informs the user if any errors occur during compression or decompression, improving the overall robustness.

File Format Flexibility:
The tool can handle multiple file formats, such as plain text files, binary files, and even simple image files (if the algorithm supports it). The program's design allows it to be extended in the future to handle more file types.

User-Friendly Interface:
The tool provides a simple, command-line interface (CLI) for users to specify their desired compression or decompression tasks. It accepts arguments like the input file name, output file name, and the operation type (compress or decompress).

Technical Details:

Language Used: C
Core Concepts:
Implementing compression algorithms (Huffman, RLE, LZW).
File I/O operations using standard C functions like fopen(), fclose(), fread(), and fwrite().
Bit-level manipulation for efficient storage and compression.
Dynamic memory allocation for handling file contents and buffers.
Encoding and decoding schemes for compressing and restoring data.
Error handling and validation of input/output files.
Libraries: The program uses standard C libraries like stdio.h, stdlib.h, and string.h for basic file handling, string manipulation, and memory management.
Use Case: This data compression tool is useful in scenarios where large amounts of data need to be stored or transmitted more efficiently. It's ideal for compressing text files, logs, documents, and basic image files (depending on the algorithm used). The tool can be used in file storage systems, network transmission applications, and any situation requiring reduced file sizes without loss of information.

Conclusion: The Data Compression Tool in C is an educational project that provides a practical understanding of how data compression algorithms work. By implementing standard compression techniques like Huffman Coding or Run-Length Encoding, the project enables users to explore data optimization, binary operations, and file manipulation at a deeper level. The tool can be further enhanced to support advanced algorithms, larger file types, and more complex compression schemes. It serves as an excellent resource for learning about data compression, system optimization, and C programming.
